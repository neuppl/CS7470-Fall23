# CS 7470: Topics in Programming Languages: Foundations of Probabilistic Programming

* Instructor: <a href="https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/home/sholtzen/">Steven Holtzen</a>, `s.holtzen@northeastern.edu`
* Session: Fall 2023
* Meeting time: Tuesday/Friday 9:50 am - 11:30 am (EST)
* Location: Ryder Hall 433 (email Steven for remote participation link)
* Office hours by appointment

Probabilistic programming languages (PPLs) use the syntax and semantics of
programming languages to define probabilistic models. PPLs enable a diverse
audience – data scientists, systems designers, medical doctors, etc. – to design
and reason about probabilistic systems. PPLs are becoming a central topic in
artificial intelligence and programming languages research, with increasing
interest from industry and academia in designing and applying PPLs.

The goal of this course is to introduce the core ideas of probabilistic
programming languages: probabilistic inference, semantics, program analysis,
language design, and applications. The course will consist of formal lectures as
well as research presentations by students surveying the modern landscape of
developments in probabilistic programming. There will be a minor project
involving implementing a probabilistic programming language, and a self-directed
term project that aims to deeply explore some of the core ideas of probabilistic
programming.

### Evaluation

The course grade will be determined by the following evaluation metrics:

* 30% minor projects (15% each)
* 10% problem sets
* 60% final course project

All graded material is turned in on <a href="https://canvas.northeastern.edu/">Canvas</a>.
